"My name is Shayan Anique Akhtar, and I achieved the Microsoft Certified Professional Certifications at the age of 16. I obtained certifications in Microsoft Certified Technology for Windows Phone Application Development and Windows 7 Configuration and Deployment. Later, I completed the track of Microsoft Certified Professional Developer examination in Windows Azure Cloud Application Development. Additionally, I built a game for Windows Phone 7.1, and the Government of Pakistan honored my achievements and dedication towards technology.

Afterward, I shifted my focus towards Cybersecurity Research, where I engage in pen-testing, vulnerability detection, and software tweaking."
