The Windows Developer Preview introduces a new development platform for creating Metro style apps. What is a Metro style app you say?

“Metro style apps are full screen apps tailored to your users’ needs, tailored to the device they run on, tailored for touch interaction, and tailored to the Windows user interface. Windows helps you interact with your users, and your users interact with your app.”

One of my friend asked me where one could find Design Guidelines for Windows 8 Metro apps. Bonny Lau, from the Windows team, shared a terrific link to the new [Windows Dev Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/), outlining comprehensive guidelines from planning to building your Metro style app. These guidelines also cover new UI lingo (app bar, charms bar, snap view, etc.), animations, and more.
