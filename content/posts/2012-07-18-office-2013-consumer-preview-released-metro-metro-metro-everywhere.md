As we all are office geek we use it on daily basis for documents, spreadsheets, presentation and so on.

This year Microsoft done something different revising their own UI they added Metro in it like Windows 8 since there as no specific download and licenses for Microsoft Office 2013 you can download the beta version which is in modern world called as Consumer Previews to test what Microsoft is actually doing with their products. One thing Skydrive is fully integrated with Office 2013 like Windows 8 which is a good thing because if any disaster happens with us our important documents and files will be save and when it rains we can see it<img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile" alt="Open-mouthed smile" src="http://shayananique.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile.png" /> I am kidding. 

Perhaps the biggest change to Office 2013 isn&#8217;t the way it looks or its features, but rather the way documents are delivered along with some important under-the-hood changes. Microsoft is really pushing the ability to create a Word document on a Windows PC and edit it on a Windows Phone, Windows 8 tablet, or any Windows 7- or Windows 8-based PC with an internet connection. Home users can store documents in Microsoft&#8217;s SkyDrive cloud storage and businesses can use a range of the company&#8217;s SharePoint offerings. Office 2013â€™s big innovation is its ability to let users stream a full-featured version of Office to a PC with personal settings intact â€” an on-demand Office suite whenever you require it. This is a big step from previous versions of Office that included cloud-based storage options, but never really tied them together into one neat package.

Office on demand is a powerful aspect to Microsoft&#8217;s Office 2013 subscription offering, providing a way to access a full version of Office wherever you are. The service lets you stream a full-featured Office application to any internet-connected PC running Windows 7 and Windows 8, providing access to the settings and documents you use regularly. Simply put, you can sign in to a streaming version of Office at a friendâ€™s PC and finish a document; the app will then be removed from the PC once it&#8217;s closed. This all requires an Office 365 Home Premium subscription, but its ease-of-use makes it a compelling prospect for users who are comfortable using Microsoft&#8217;s Office suite and require more document editing functionality than Google Docs or Microsoft&#8217;s own Office Web Apps provide. Despite this, you can still opt to simply buy a standalone version of the Office 2013 desktop software and utilize SkyDrive as an online storage hub for documents. You won&#8217;t get the streaming Office 2013 apps, but you&#8217;ll benefit from the cloud and avoid having to pay a subscription fee.

[So Keep enjoy the preview of Microsoft Office 2013.](http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/)
