Microsoft **Silverlight** is the realization of the .NET Framework supported by various browsers and platforms and intended for [.Net software developers](http://www.netsoftwaredevelopment.com/) to create and present multimedia and [RIA applications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Internet_application) of the new generation in the Internet. **Silverlight**combines the possibilities of the server, the Internet and the personal computer; the possibilities of the control code and dynamic languages, declarative and traditional programming as well as powerful tools of Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).

**Silverlight**allows .Net software developers to create ultramodern applications that include the following features:

  * **Silverlight**technology is supported by various browsers and platforms such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari and Google Chrome as well Microsoft Windows OS and Apple Mac OS X.
  * **Silverlight**download and installation will take a few seconds.
  * **Silverlight**performs video and audio streaming and provides opportunities for scaling the video quality: from mobile device and PC browsers to video modes 720p for high definition television.
  * **Silverlight**also has stylish graphics that can be managed by users — drag, rotate and scale — directly in the browser.
  * **Silverlight** counts data and updates the displayed content but doesn’t interrupt the user’s work while updating the whole page.
  * Applications developed with **Silverlight** can be launched in web browsers or can be adjusted so as users can launch them on their PCs, outside the browser.

[Web application developers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_development) and graphics designers can develop **Silverlight** applications in many ways.**Silverlight** can be used for developing multimedia and graphics and for working separately using dynamic languages and the control code. **Silverlight** also allows using the high professional tools such as Visual Studio for writing the code and Microsoft Expression Blend for creating models and graphical design.
