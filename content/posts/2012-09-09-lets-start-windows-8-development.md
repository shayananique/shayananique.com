So, I am digging in to Windows 8 Development since the last //BUILD Conference, Yup! That’s true I am hacking around Windows 8 story since the first Developer Preview version come out, Now I am running Windows 8 Pro (RTM) on my All machines because I am in love with it. Currently, I am porting my [Matchem Poker](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-GB/apps/081f188d-fe71-4015-b568-b4f1186bf039) game and [Sound Recorder](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-GB/apps/6dbd2538-0df6-4231-8ae9-62ea18108c8c) application for Windows Phone to Windows 8. I am using a smart program called “MonoGame”. It is a program which you can use to port your XNA Windows Phone Game to Windows 8 <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Metro</span>.

I will post my full porting story to my Blog Soon.
